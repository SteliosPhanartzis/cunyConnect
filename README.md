# cunyConnect
QCHack 2018 Hackathon Entry

A web app that pulls CUNY events for each school directly from the school's calendar. A remedy for the existing CUNY events page, which requires that events from each school must be manually added by each school. The end goal is to make CUNY students across the many different campuses aware of events at other fellow CUNY schools and in turn, increase cross campus participation.
